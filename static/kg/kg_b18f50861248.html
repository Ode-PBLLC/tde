      "description": "Drip irrigation involves dripping water onto the soil at very low rates (2-20 litres/hour) from a system of small diameter plastic pipes fitted with outlets called emitters or drippers. Water is applied close to plants so that only part of the soil in which the roots grow is wetted. Drip irrigation can provide asmuch as 90 per cent water-use efficiency and has been applied in arid and semi-aridzones as well as in areas with irregular flows of water."
