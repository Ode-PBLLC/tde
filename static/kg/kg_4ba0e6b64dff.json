In the later, it is a shallow basin filled with some sort of filler material (substrate), usually sand or gravel, and planted with vegetation tolerant of saturated conditions to mimic the function of mangrove forest or salt marshes. In the context of water purification, constructed wetlands make use of the natural purification processes of vegetation, soils and microbes to remove contaminants from discharge and improve water quality."
