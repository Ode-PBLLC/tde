However, the country faces significant challenges in meeting its climate goals, particularly regarding deforestation, where rates surged to approximately 10,851 km² in 2020 after initial progress from 2004-2012, undermining Brazil's NDC commitments to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030 ^3^. ^4^", "## Institutional Governance and Coordination ^4^", "Brazil's climate governance operates through the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change (CIM), established by Decree 11.550/2023, which brings together 23 ministries under the leadership of the Chief of Staff of the Presidency ^2^. The CIM coordinates implementation of the National Policy on Climate Change, defines successive nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, and approves sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans ^2^. The committee meets every six months and includes non-voting representatives from civil society, interfederative coordination, and scientific advisory bodies ^2^. ^5^", "At the subnational level, states are developing their own climate frameworks. Amapá enacted comprehensive climate legislation (State Law 3.128/2024) establishing mitigation objectives including forest conservation, bio-economy development, and renewable energy transition ^6^. Maranhão's State Policy on Climate Change (State Law 12.301/2024) requires development of sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans, disaster risk reduction strategies, and municipal climate policies ^7^. São Paulo has developed PAC2050 with net-zero emissions goals by 2050 and is creating a State Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience (PEARC) focused on infrastructure resilience and vulnerable populations ^8^. ^9^", "## National Climate Planning and Strategy", "Brazil is developing a new Climate Plan (Plano Clima) that will include a National Adaptation Strategy with sixteen sectoral adaptation plans covering agriculture, biodiversity, cities, energy, health, and other key areas ^10^. The strategy establishes nine national adaptation objectives, including increasing resilience of populations and infrastructure, promoting food security, ensuring water security, and protecting ecosystems ^10^. This builds upon Brazil's existing 2016 National Adaptation Plan (PNA), which remains in effect while under review ^10^.", "Climate change integration into national development planning is established in law and policy, though implementation details are not specified ^11^. The country has also enacted Federal Law 15.042/2024 establishing the Brazilian Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading System (SBCE), which includes provisions for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs), though implementing regulations from CIM are still under development ^12^.", "## Sectoral Policies and Implementation", "Brazil's energy sector policies include mandates for greenhouse gas emissions reduction in fuel commercialization through the RenovaBio program ^13^^14^. Recent amendments to environmental legislation have expanded mitigation requirements to include low-carbon hydrogen and derivatives alongside biofuels ^15^. The country's energy expansion scenario through the ten-year planning period is reported to meet and surpass 2020 targets and align with NDC commitments for the energy sector ^16^.", "The transition to a low-carbon economy is explicitly referenced in policy documents as a key objective, emphasizing greenhouse gas reduction and preservation of natural carbon sinks ^17^. Transportation and energy sectors are specifically targeted for emissions mitigation through biofuels and other low-carbon alternatives ^15^^18^.", "## Deforestation Challenges and Performance Gaps", "Brazil's climate performance faces significant challenges from deforestation patterns. The map shows deforestation point locations representing polygons of 100 hectares or larger, totaling approximately 1,278,455 hectares across 4,875 locations ^4^. Historical data reveals that while Brazil made substantial progress reducing deforestation from 2004-2012 through policies like the Amazon Fund, rates surged again from 2012-2020 ^3^.", "This deforestation surge has led to increased carbon emissions that contradict Brazil's NDC commitments to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030 ^3^. The effectiveness of climate policies is further complicated by governance challenges, including implementation difficulties with the National Policy for Payments for Environmental Services (PNPSA) due to legislative vetoes ^3^.", "## Climate Adaptation and Extreme Events", "Brazil faces increasing climate extremes that significantly impact ecosystems and agriculture, with the IPCC expressing high confidence that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods ^19^. These climate impacts create additional challenges for meeting national climate goals and highlight the importance of the comprehensive adaptation planning currently under development ^20^."], "metadata": {"citations": [{"marker": "^1^", "number": 1, "evidence_id": "F13", "server": "cpr", "tool": "run_query", "source_title": "Climate Policy Radar Passage Library", "source_type": "Decree", "citation_id": "passage_CCLW.executive.10453.5271_11"}, {"marker": "^2^", "number": 2, "evidence_id": "F1", "server": "lse", "tool": "run_query", "source_title": "NDC Align", "source_type": "Law -
