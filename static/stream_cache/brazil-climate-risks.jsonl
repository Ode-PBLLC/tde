The Amazon region confronts heightened vulnerability to droughts and floods exacerbated by deforestation, while the Northeast grapples with water scarcity and the Southeast faces urban climate risks ^2^^3^.", "## Regional Climate Risk Distribution", "Brazil's climate risks vary significantly by region, requiring tailored adaptation strategies ^4^. The map shows extreme heat exposure concentrated primarily in the Central-West region, with Mato Grosso leading at 2,289,823.4 km² of land in the extreme-heat top quintile, followed by Mato Grosso do Sul at 1,573,216.81 km² and Bahia at 1,464,523.12 km² ^1^. At the municipal level, Corumbá in Mato Grosso do Sul shows the largest exposure area at 423,973.71 km², with Cáceres and Cocalinho in Mato Grosso following at 132,479.85 km² and 111,779.72 km² respectively ^5^.", "## Amazon Region Vulnerabilities", "The Amazon faces particularly acute climate risks, with high susceptibility to drought that threatens both biodiversity and carbon storage capacity ^2^. The region experiences increased frequency of extreme weather events, including both droughts and floods, which are exacerbated by ongoing deforestation and climate change ^3^. Changes in precipitation patterns and temperature are expected to disrupt ecosystems, significantly impacting biodiversity and carbon cycling processes ^3^. Corporate regulatory filings indicate growing concern about climate change affecting regional atmospheric circulation patterns, potentially leading to more extreme meteorological conditions ^6^.", "## Policy Framework and Institutional Response", "Brazil has established comprehensive institutional mechanisms to address climate risks through the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change (CIM), which coordinates federal climate action across 23 ministries and meets regularly to oversee implementation ^7^. The Ministry of Finance has integrated climate considerations into budgetary processes through specialized subsecretariats handling fiscal policy, agricultural policy, and sustainable economic development ^8^. The country maintains an iterative climate risk assessment process through the National Adaptation Plan (PNA) and the AdaptaBrasil platform, which analyzes climate risks across strategic sectors including water resources, food security, energy security, and infrastructure ^9^.", "## Financial Sector Climate Risk Management", "Brazilian financial regulators have implemented comprehensive climate risk disclosure requirements through multiple resolutions from the National Monetary Council and Central Bank ^10^. Large and medium financial institutions must integrate climate risks into their risk management frameworks and publish annual Social, Environmental, and Climate Risks and Opportunities Reports (GRSAC) ^10^. These regulations apply to financial institutions across segments S1 through S5, mandating climate risk assessment of credit operations and securities exposures ^10^.", "## Implementation Gaps and Development Needs", "Despite the policy framework, implementation challenges persist, with disaster risk management plans that include climate adaptation still under development and showing evidence of poor implementation ^11^. Some states like Amazonas lack comprehensive Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessments, though the state's Climate Change Policy created a Centre for Adaptation to Climate Change and Environmental Risk Management ^12^. The Federal District has developed adaptation plans based on vulnerability and climate risk studies, particularly focusing on extreme climate events related to water resources and temperatures
