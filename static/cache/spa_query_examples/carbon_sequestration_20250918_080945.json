  "question": "How much carbon does the Amazon sequester every year?",
  "answer": "The Amazon rainforest is estimated to sequester approximately -0.22 ± 0.30 Pg C per year, indicating that mature forests act as carbon sinks (220511 SPA 2021 Part I p.257). However, there are significant uncertainties in these estimates, particularly regarding emissions from forest degradation, decomposition, and fire (220511 SPA 2021 Part I p.257). \n\nThis carbon sequestration capacity is crucial for climate mitigation efforts, and maintaining the integrity of these forests is essential for sustaining their role in carbon storage. Policy implications include the need for enhanced conservation strategies, restoration of degraded areas, and the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation to maximize the Amazon's carbon sink potential. Addressing these issues can also contribute to the broader climate-biodiversity-people nexus, supporting both ecological health and local livelihoods.",
