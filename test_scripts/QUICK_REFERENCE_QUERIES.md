# NDC Align - Quick Reference Query Guide

Use these proven query patterns to get the best results from NDC Align data.

---

## ✅ WORKS WELL - Use These Patterns

### NDC Targets & Commitments
```
✅ "What is Brazil's long-term climate neutrality target according to its NDC?"
✅ "What are Brazil's interim emissions reduction targets for 2035?"
✅ "Does Brazil have a formal emissions target for 2030?"
✅ "What greenhouse gases does Brazil's NDC cover?"
```

### NDC vs. Domestic Policy Alignment
```
✅ "How do Brazil's NDC commitments compare to its domestic laws?"
✅ "Is Brazil's 2050 climate neutrality target in domestic law?"
✅ "What is the status of implementing Brazil's NDC commitments?"
✅ "Are Brazil's NDC targets legally binding domestically?"
```

### Institutional Coordination
```
✅ "What is Brazil's main institutional body for coordinating climate policy?"
✅ "What is the role of the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change (CIM)?"
✅ "How does Brazil coordinate climate policy across government ministries?"
```

### Climate Governance
```
✅ "What institutions are responsible for setting Brazil's climate policy direction?"
✅ "Which bodies are responsible for strategic climate planning in Brazil?"
✅ "How does Brazil integrate climate policy across different sectors?"
```

### Monitoring & Evidence
```
✅ "How does Brazil monitor its greenhouse gas emissions?"
✅ "What institutions provide climate science for Brazil's policy making?"
✅ "How does Brazil monitor deforestation?" (will also use KG/PRODES)
```

### National Climate Framework
```
✅ "What is Brazil's main cross-cutting climate policy framework?"
✅ "What is the Plano Clima and what does it include?"
✅ "What is Brazil's National Policy on Climate Change?"
```

### State-Level Climate Laws
```
✅ "Does São Paulo state have its own climate change law?"
✅ "What climate laws does Amazonas state have?"
✅ "What are the key provisions of São Paulo's State Law 13.798/2009?"
```

### State Governance & Institutions
```
✅ "What institutions does Acre state have for climate policy coordination?"
✅ "How does São Paulo state coordinate its climate policies?"
✅ "What governance structures does Mato Grosso have for climate action?"
```

### State Transparency & Participation
```
✅ "What institutions does Acre state have to ensure transparency in climate policy?"
✅ "How does São Paulo ensure public participation in climate decisions?"
✅ "What public participation mechanisms does Alagoas state have for climate policy?"
```

### Multi-State Comparison
```
✅ "Compare climate policies between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states"
✅ "Compare transparency mechanisms between Acre and Amazonas states"
✅ "Which Brazilian states have the most comprehensive climate laws?"
```

## ❌ DOESN'T WORK WELL - Avoid These Patterns

### Too Generic
```
❌ "What are Brazil's climate policies?" (too broad, many sources)
❌ "Tell me about climate change in Brazil" (too vague)
❌ "Brazilian climate action" (unclear what aspect)
❌ "State level transparency" (too generic)
```

### Asking for Primary Documents (Use CPR Instead)
```
❌ "Show me Brazil's NDC document" → Use CPR
❌ "What does Brazil's climate law say?" → Use CPR for full text
❌ "Read me the PNMC law" → Use CPR
```

### Asking for Data/Statistics (Use Other Sources)
```
❌ "Show me Brazil's emissions data" → Use KG or other datasets
❌ "Brazil deforestation statistics" → Use PRODES or KG
❌ "Historical emissions trend" → Use KG or TPI (though TPI is in NDC Align)
```

### Scientific/Technical Questions (Use IPCC/WMO)
```
❌ "How will climate change affect Brazil?" → Use IPCC
❌ "Climate projections for Amazon" → Use IPCC/SPA
❌ "Impact of 2°C warming on Brazil" → Use IPCC
```

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Be Specific About States
**Instead of**: "State transparency measures"
**Ask**: "What transparency mechanisms does Acre state have?"

### Tip 2: Query Related Concepts
**Instead of**: "Transparency"
**Ask**: "Public participation" or "Monitoring and reporting" (where transparency info lives)

### Tip 3: Ask About Alignment
**Instead of**: "What is Brazil's climate target?"
**Ask**: "How does Brazil's NDC target compare to its domestic law?"

### Tip 4: Name the Institution
**Instead of**: "Who coordinates climate policy?"
**Ask**: "What is the role of CIM (Interministerial Committee on Climate Change)?"

### Tip 5: Ask About Implementation Status
**Instead of**: "Does Brazil have a policy?"
**Ask**: "What is the implementation status of [specific policy]?"

### Tip 6: Focus on Governance & Frameworks
**Instead of**: "Climate policy details"
**Ask**: "What governance framework does Brazil use?" or "What institutions implement climate policy?"

## 🎯 Query Templates

### Template 1: NDC Alignment Check
```
"Is Brazil's [specific commitment] from its NDC reflected in domestic law?"

Examples:
- "Is Brazil's 2050 climate neutrality commitment in domestic law?"
- "Is Brazil's deforestation target from the NDC legally binding domestically?"
```

### Template 2: Institutional Role
```
"What is the role of [institution name] in Brazil's climate governance?"

Examples:
- "What is the role of CIM in Brazil's climate governance?"
- "What is the role of INPE in emissions monitoring?"
```

### Template 3: State-Specific
```
"What [aspect] does [state name] state have for climate [topic]?"

Examples:
- "What institutions does Acre state have for climate coordination?"
- "What monitoring does São Paulo state have for emissions?"
```

### Template 4: Implementation Status
```
"What is the status of [specific target/policy] in Brazil?"

Examples:
- "What is the status of Brazil's 2030 emissions target?"
- "What is the implementation status of the Plano Clima?"
```

### Template 5: Comparison
```
"Compare [aspect] between [entity 1] and [entity 2]"

Examples:
- "Compare transparency between Acre and São Paulo states"
- "Compare Brazil's NDC target to its domestic law"
```

## 📊 What Each Query Type Returns

| Query Type | What You'll Get | Example Citation |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| NDC Targets | Official commitments, percentages, years | "NDC Align via NDC - CCLW" |
| Alignment | Comparison of NDC vs. domestic law | "NDC Align via Policy - CCLW" |
| Institutions | Names, roles, mandates of bodies | "NDC Align via Policy - CCLW" |
| State Laws | Specific state legislation details | "NDC Align via State's Climate Law" |
| Implementation | Status (in law/policy, under development, etc.) | "NDC Align via Policy - CCLW" |
| Governance | Frameworks, coordination mechanisms | "NDC Align via Law - CCLW" |

## 🚦 How to Tell if NDC Align Was Used

### Look for these in citations:
- ✅ "NDC Align via Policy - CCLW"
- ✅ "NDC Align via Law - CCLW"
- ✅ "NDC Align via NDC - CCLW"
- ✅ "NDC Align via State's Climate Law"
- ✅ References to CIM (Interministerial Committee)
- ✅ Mentions of Resolution 3/2023
- ✅ State Law numbers (e.g., Law 13.798/2009)

### Signs other sources were used:
- Only CPR, IPCC, or SPA citations (no NDC Align)
- Actual quoted policy text (that's CPR)
- Scientific projections (that's IPCC)
- Deforestation statistics (that's PRODES/KG)

## 📋 Quick Checklist: Before Asking

- [ ] Is my query about **Brazil**? (NDC Align is Brazil-specific)
- [ ] Am I asking about **alignment** between NDC and domestic policy? (NDC Align's strength)
- [ ] Am I asking about **governance/institutions**? (NDC Align has this)
- [ ] Am I asking about a **specific state**? (Name the state)
- [ ] Am I looking for **implementation status**? (NDC Align tracks this)

If you answered YES to any of these, NDC Align should help!

If you're looking for:
- [ ] Primary policy documents → Try CPR
- [ ] Emissions/deforestation data → Try KG or PRODES
- [ ] Climate science → Try IPCC/WMO

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "My query didn't use NDC Align"
1. Check if it's specific enough (generic queries may use other sources)
2. Try rephrasing to focus on alignment/governance
3. Name specific institutions or states
4. Ask about implementation status

### "The answer was too generic"
1. Be more specific about what aspect you want (transparency → public participation)
2. Name a specific state instead of "states"
3. Break into multiple specific queries

### "I got CPR instead of NDC Align"
- This is correct if you asked for primary documents
- NDC Align is for **analyzing** policy, not reading full text
- Rephrase to ask about alignment or implementation
