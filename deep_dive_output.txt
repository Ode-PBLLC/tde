[17:25:13] THINKING [analysis]: 🔬 The query asks for a relationship between deforestation proximity and biodiversity impact scores, but the current data lacks detailed PDF metrics and spatial correlation analysis.|||FOLLOW_UP:["What are the specific PDF metrics for each company in the dataset?", "What are the exact deforestation proximity indicators being measured?", "What are the geographic coordinates of company operations in relation to deforestation zones?", "How do biodiversity impact scores change with distance from deforestation areas?", "What is the year-over-year trend in both metrics for each company?"]
